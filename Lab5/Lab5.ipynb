    "Low-pass filtering is a technique used to reduce noise and smooth images by attenuating high-frequency components in the frequency domain. High frequencies in an image correspond to rapid intensity changes, such as edges and fine details, while low frequencies represent gradual variations and overall shapes. By applying a low-pass filter, we suppress the high-frequency information, resulting in a blurred or smoothed version of the original image. This process is particularly useful for removing noise and preparing images for further processing tasks. In the frequency domain, different types of low-pass filters—such as ideal, Butterworth, and Gaussian—can be designed to control the degree and characteristics of smoothing.\n",

A higher order results in a sharper transition, while a lower order yields a smoother roll-off. The filter is defined by its cutoff frequency (`cutoff_freq`) and order (`order`), and its transfer function ensures no abrupt changes, reducing ringing artifacts in the filtered image.

    "Highboost filtering is a sharpening technique that enhances the high-frequency components of an image, making edges and fine details more prominent. The process involves first applying a low-pass filter (such as Ideal, Butterworth, or Gaussian) to obtain a blurred version of the image. The high-frequency details are then extracted by subtracting this blurred image from the original. By adding a scaled version of these details back to the original image (controlled by the scaling factor `k`), highboost filtering produces a sharpened result. This method is particularly useful for highlighting important features in images while suppressing noise and smooth regions.
